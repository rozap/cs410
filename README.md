### Things you need:
  * MySQL (thru apt, user/pass settings are in settings.py)
  * * proper python connectors (libmysqlclient-dev18?)
  * * Or you know, postgres if you aren't a masochist - it's a django based project and there is no mysql specific stuff
  * RabbitMQ (thru apt, default settings)
  * pip install -r requirements.txt
